# Digital mirror

This is repository is used to display useful information to my personal mirror. It is not generic and you will need certain API_keys to make it work (SL & Wodify).

## TODO-List

* Add tests for code using *supertest*- and *mocha*-modules.
* Refactor DB-connection and hide connection-parts.
* Create common interface for API-communication.
* Implementation of grocery list (front- and backend).
* Update solution for implementation of new github release (continuous deployment).
* Rebuild messageNotification.html.
* General code cleanup (especially in models).
